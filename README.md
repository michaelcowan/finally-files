# Installation
This module is designed to add a custom input to [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. It is assumed that these are already included in your project.

1. Copy `file_input.rb` to `config/initializers/simple_form`
2. Restart Rails
3. Profit!!!

# This again
Yeah, I know. There are a heap of really good 'pretty file input' examples out there for Bootstrap already, so why another? 

Well, this one doesnt require any css or js to be added to your assets. A pretty file input is an ugly leg sticking out of any project, at least this way its all kept in one place.

Also you know that thing where you want the file input to have a width of 100% and the button ends up underneath the text input? This doesnt do that.
